# LSP Code Sample Component

Show your code. Exactly how you see it in editor.

This React component renders a code sample expressed as a specific
object. The code is semantically highlighted.

Requires Node.js 21 in case the React component will be ran at server side (due to `Object.groupBy`).

## Installation

```bash
npm i lsp-code-sample
```
